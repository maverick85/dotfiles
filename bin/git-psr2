# This command check for PHP issues for all the files in git staged area.
# If you pass a branch name, it will also check for PHP issues found on the
# current branch against the branch you pass.
#
# E.g.: if you want to see what php code is messed up against the master use:
# git psr2 master
# 
# Requires PHP Code Sniffer (phpcs).
#

# Checks for PHP code issues.
# Accepts 1 optional param which is the branch we want to check code against
# if the param is passed will check for committed code up to that branch
# if no param is passed, check for staged code
